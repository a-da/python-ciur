Ciur is a scrapper layer for developing.

Export all scrapper related code into separate layer.

If you are annoyed from sql spaghetti inside php and inline css inside html
THEN you also are annoyed from xpath/css code inside crawler.

Ciur give you additional possibility to fix previous headache with adding additional layer.
