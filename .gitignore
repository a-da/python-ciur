# Lines that start with '#' are comments.
# For a project mostly in C, the following would be a good set of
# exclude patterns (uncomment them if you want to use them):

# pytest trash
/.cache
tests/.cache
ciur/.cache

# python related
*.pyc
*.[oa]

# Ignore the PyCharm project files
/.idea

# ignore log files
*.log
*.cout

# ignore vim trash file
*.sw[klmonpaefghij]

# ignore trash files from pip install
build

# vagrant config
/.vagrant

# test coverage
tests/htmlcov
